- X Account Profile Review 
  - Identified mismatch between current bio/handle and the core intention (sharing a paradigm shift).
  - Uncovered user's limiting belief about creating a new account ('Don't want to look like I'm riding a trend').
- User decided to create a completely new X account for sharing the paradigm shift.
- User realized that the desire to 'eradicate those who try to control' is actually a reflection of their own desire to control (win-lose/lose-win dynamics).
- User selected the name/title 'Evangelist' (エヴァンジェリスト) for the new account.
- User wants to align the new account persona with 'Evangelion' (エヴァンゲリオン).
- User selected the 'Pilot' ( protagonist ) Evangelion theme. Emphasizing the process of remembering/awakening alongside the audience.
- User suggested turning the Evangelion/Paradigm Shift concept into a game.
- User prefers the role of 'Misato' (guide/commander) with participants as 'Shinji' (pilots). Raised concerns about copyright.
- User approved the 'Evangelion homage' community concept (Misato/Shinji dynamic without copyright infringement). Ready to proceed to the next step.
- User suggested the name 'Satomi' (サトミ) as an anagram/homage to Misato.
- User requested assistance with creating the new X account as they do not know how.
- User is creating a new Google Account for the project and asked for advice on the business category.
- User created the new X account: https://x.com/CommanderSatomi
- User reported that the X profile bio text is too long and gets cut off.
- User updated project name from '第３新パラダイム移行計画' to 'シン・五次元移行計画'.
- User reported that the X post text is over the character limit.
- User published the first post on https://x.com/CommanderSatomi.
- User requested the LINE welcome message to have a 'Misato' (friendly/encouraging commander) tone.
- User refined LINE welcome message: preferring 'achieving dreams/becoming happy' over 'playing thoroughly'.
- User asked if the user's name can be inserted after 'Welcome' in the LINE message. Confirmed that LINE Official Accounts have a 'Nickname' insertion feature.
- User asked if LINE can automatically append '君' (kun) for males and 'さん' (san) for females. Confirmed this is not possible natively in standard LINE Official Accounts.
- User decided to append '君' (kun) to all LINE nicknames as an homage to 'Shinji-kun'.
- User successfully created the LINE Official Account. Need to instruct user on how to check it or ask them to provide the LINE ID/link.
- User created LINE account: https://line.me/R/ti/p/@154hnucn?ts=02261312&oat_content=url
- User provided the short LINE link: https://lin.ee/1wxsCidf
